## The Royal Pardon Controversy

### Pardon and Public Outcry
In July 2013, on the occasion of Morocco's **Throne Day**, King Mohammed VI granted pardons to 48 Spanish prisoners as a gesture of goodwill towards Spain. Among them was Daniel Galván Viña. However, the release of a convicted pedophile sparked outrage in Morocco, leading to nationwide protests.

Moroccans took to the streets in cities such as **Casablanca** and **Rabat**, demanding accountability and questioning the monarchy's decision. Many saw the pardon as a miscarriage of justice and a failure to protect vulnerable children.

### Revocation of the Pardon
Following the protests and public backlash, King Mohammed VI revoked Galván’s pardon, claiming he was unaware of the gravity of Galván's crimes. The Moroccan government described the decision as a bureaucratic oversight.

## Arrest in Spain
After his release, Galván fled to Spain. On **August 5, 2013**, he was arrested in **Murcia** following an international warrant issued by Morocco. However, Spain's legal system denied Morocco’s request for extradition due to Galván’s Spanish nationality.

### Enforcement of Sentence in Spain
Despite the extradition denial, Spanish courts agreed to enforce Galván's Moroccan sentence. He was ordered to serve the **remaining 30 years** of his sentence in a Spanish prison, ensuring that justice would be upheld.
